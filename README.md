Made recursively in python. (understand that this was for a project and is extremely inefficient.) 

- Change the speed of the solver by changing the time.sleep() in the solve_sudoku function, the second time.sleep is the backtrack speed. 

change the number of cells pre-filled by changing the cells_to_remain arguement in the create_sudoku() function, the initial arguement in remove_numbers() is the default
* note that the less cells that remain the longer the program will take to solve the puzzle, 20 is the recommended min
